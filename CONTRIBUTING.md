# Contributing to ternary-delta

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This repository is not a general ternary playground. It is a **delta-oriented reference** whose primary goal is clarity, not expansion.

Contributions are welcome only insofar as they **increase precision, correctness, or evidentiary strength**.

---

## Guiding principle

> **Every claim must be classifiable.
> Every classification must be defensible.**

If a contribution cannot be clearly labeled as **Proven**, **Plausible**, or **Speculative**, it does not belong here.

---

## What this repository accepts

### 1) Clarifications and refinements

* Tightening language
* Removing ambiguity
* Adding missing constraints
* Improving definitions

### 2) Evidence-backed additions

* Reproducible benchmarks
* Formal reasoning
* Clearly scoped demonstrations

### 3) Documented failure modes

* Counterexamples
* Negative results
* Performance regressions
* Toolchain incompatibilities

Failure documentation is considered a **positive contribution**.

---

## What this repository does not accept

* Advocacy or evangelism
* Roadmaps or promises
* Hardware hype
* Claims without evidence
* Speculative content presented as settled fact
* Historical essays without direct relevance to semantic deltas

---

## Evidence taxonomy (required)

All non-trivial claims must be labeled as one of:

### **Proven**

* Derivable from mathematics, or
* Reproducible via reference code or benchmark

### **Plausible**

* Demonstrated in constrained contexts, but
* Not yet validated broadly

### **Speculative**

* Dependent on new hardware, new standards, or untested assumptions

Mislabeling claims is grounds for rejection.

---

## Canonicalization requirements

Any contribution involving numeric representation **must** specify:

* Whether canonical form is required
* Where normalization boundaries occur
* What happens if canonicalization is violated

Submissions that treat canonicalization as an implementation detail will be rejected.

---

## Benchmarks and measurements

If performance is discussed:

* Benchmarks must be end-to-end
* Methodology must be documented
* Binary baselines must be included
* Negative results must not be hidden

Microbenchmarks without context are discouraged.

---

## Style and tone

* Neutral, technical, and precise
* No marketing language
* No appeals to inevitability
* No rhetorical framing

This repository values **restraint**.

---

## Review process

Maintainers will review contributions for:

1. Correctness
2. Scope alignment
3. Evidence classification
4. Consistency with existing documents

Revisions may be requested to narrow scope or reclassify claims.

---

## A note on disagreement

Disagreement is expected.

If you believe a claim is misclassified or unsupported:

* Propose a correction
* Provide evidence or counterexamples
* Keep discussion scoped to the document

Arguments about “the future of computing” are out of scope.

---

## Closing reminder

This repository exists to make discussion **harder to distort**, not easier to promote.

Precision is the contribution.

---

### Structural status

At this point, `ternary-delta` contains:

* A complete conceptual spine
* Explicit constraints
* Failure documentation
* A responsible adoption path
* Terminology control
* Evidence governance
